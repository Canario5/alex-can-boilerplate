# Vulnerabilities to ignore in the project example
# CVE-2021-44228

# Ignore misconfigurations
# Container drops privileges via gosu in docker-entrypoint.sh script. Application runs as non-root user 'vscode' at runtime. This is the recommended pattern for containers with bind mounts.
# TODO: In future (when stable) move to .trivyignore.yaml file which supports specify exact file -> Dockerfile.dev in this case.
